<p class = "chapter">
<span class = "firstword">Once</span> upon a time there lived a king
called Bubi the First, who was very kind to poor children and mice. For
the children he built a factory for making dolls and cardboard horses,
for the benefit of the mice he made wise laws to stop cats catching
them, and absolutely forbade the use of mouse-traps.
<span class = "figright">
<img src = "images/silh_8.png" width = "60" height = "92"
alt = "silhouette"></span>
Bubi began to reign when he was only six years old, under the care of
his mother, who was very good and clever, and who watched over him and
guided his steps, as good children are guided by their Guardian
Angel.</p>

<p class = "caption">

<!-- png 18-->

<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<!-- png 19-->
<p>Bubi was a darling little boy, and when on great days they put on his
gold crown and his embroidered robes, the gold of his crown was not
brighter than his hair nor the ermine of his robes softer than his
cheeks and hands. He was just like a little Dresden china figure which
had been put to sit on a throne instead of standing on the chimney
piece.</p>

<p>One day while the King was eating his bread and milk, one of his
teeth began to wobble. There was a great fuss and the Court doctors
arrived in a hurry.<span class = "para">&nbsp;*</span>
<span class = "figleft">
<img src = "images/silh_9.png" width = "137" height = "115"
alt = "silhouette"></span>
They were all agreed that His Majesty had begun to change his teeth, and
at
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<!-- png 20-->
length they settled to pull out the loose one. They wanted the King to
have laughing gas, as he did when his hair was cut, as he always
fidgeted so, but Bubi was a brave little boy and made up his mind to
have it out with nothing. The oldest of the Court doctors tied a bit of
red silk round the tooth, and then gave a tweak, and he pulled so
cleverly that, while the King was making a face, out came the tooth as
round and white as a little pearl.</p>

<p><span class = "figright">
<img src = "images/silh_21.png" width = "125" height = "117"
alt = "silhouette"></span>
Then there was another fuss as to what was to be done with it, but
Bubi&rsquo;s mother, who, as we have said was a very wise Queen and
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<!-- png 23-->
very loyal to old customs,
<span class = "figleft">
<img src = "images/silh_11.png" width = "74" height = "120"
alt = "silhouette"></span>
settled that the King should write a very polite letter and put it with
the tooth in an envelope under his pillow that night, which has always
been the proper thing to do ever since the world began, and no one has
ever known Perez the Mouse forget to come and fetch the tooth and leave
a lovely present in its place.</p>

<p>King Bubi found writing that letter a dreadful task, but he managed
really quite well in the end, and only inked all his fingers, the tip of
his nose, his left ear, his right shoe and his bib.</p>

<p><span class = "figleft">
<img src = "images/silh_b2.png" width = "134" height = "94"

He went to bed very early that
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<!-- png 24-->
evening, and ordered that all the lights should be left in his room. He
put the envelope under his pillow and sat up in bed, determined to keep
awake to see Perez the Mouse, even if he had to wait all night.</p>

<img src = "images/silh_14a.png" width = "54" height = "30"

so the little King began to make up a little speech to say to him when
he did arrive. After a bit Bubi began to open his eyes very wide,
fighting against the miller who was trying to make him shut them; but
they did shut at last, and the little boy slipped down into the warm
bed-clothes, his head on the pillow, with one arm over it, as a little
bird tucks its head under its wing when it goes to sleep.</p>

<p><span class = "figleft">

<span class = "figright">

<p>King Bubi stared at him in astonishment, and Perez the Mouse, seeing
that His Majesty was awake, took off his hat and made a very low bow,
waiting to be spoken to. But the King said nothing, because he had quite
forgotten all he had made up to say, and after thinking and thinking he
faltered out at last &lsquo;Good night.&rsquo;<span class =

<span class = "figleft">

broke the ice,
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<!-- png 30-->
and the King and the mouse became the greatest friends.<span class =
"para">&nbsp;*</span>It was easy to see that Perez was a mouse who was
accustomed to polite society, and to run about on soft carpets, as he
had such very good manners.<span class = "para">&nbsp;*</span>It was
wonderful what a lot of things he could talk about which made him a very

He had two quite grown-up daughters, Adelaide and Elvira, and a son,
nearly grown up, called Adolphus,

who was studying for diplomacy in the drawer where the Minister of State
kept his most secret notes. He did not say much about Mrs. Mouse, and
the little King somehow fancied that she was rather vulgar.</p>

<p>His Majesty listened to all this with his mouth open, from time to

placed his tail out of reach, without being in the least rude.</p>

It was getting late, and the King forgot to dismiss him; so Mr. Mouse
cleverly hinted that he had
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<!-- png 36-->
to go that same night to a street not far off to fetch the tooth of a
very poor little boy called Giles. It was rather a difficult, dangerous
journey, because near there lived a very wicked cat called Don Pedro.
The King at once wanted to go too, and begged Perez to take him. The
mouse stood thinking it over and twisting his whiskers; the
responsibility was very great, and moreover he was obliged to go back to
his own house to fetch the present for little Giles.
<span class = "figleft">
<img src = "images/silh_8.png" width = "60" height = "92"
alt = "silhouette"></span>
The King said he would like to go and see the mouse&rsquo;s home, which
so much flattered Perez that he at once offered him a cup of tea and
agreed
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<!-- png 39-->
to take him to see little Giles. Perez the Mouse lived underneath a
grocer&rsquo;s shop, near a big pile of Gruyere cheeses which supplied
the whole family with breakfast, dinner and tea. Overjoyed, King Bubi
jumped out of bed and began to dress himself, when all at once Perez the
Mouse sprang on his shoulder and put the tip of his tail into His
Majesty&rsquo;s nose.<span class = "para">&nbsp;*</span>Then a wonderful
thing happened, the King sneezed very hard and turned into the most
darling little mouse you ever saw.
<span class = "figright">
<img src = "images/silh_15a.png" width = "92" height = "93"

He was all soft and shiny, and had wee green eyes like emeralds.<span

disappeared

<!-- png 38-->

<p>The way was dark and sticky, but they scampered along. Sometimes
Perez the Mouse stopped at some crossway and looked about before going
on, which rather frightened the King and made him feel little shivers
right down to the tip of his tail, and he knew that he was afraid, but
he remembered that:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>&lsquo;Fear is natural to the prudent,</p>
<p>To conquer it is to be courageous,&rsquo;</p>

Once when he heard a tremendous
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<!-- png 41-->
noise, like dozens of motor omnibuses passing over his head, he
whispered to ask Perez if that was where Don Pedro lived, but Mr. Mouse
said no with his tail, and on they went.</p>

After going down a gentle slope they came to a big cellar which felt
nice and warm and smelt very much of cheese; behind a pile of Gruyere
cheese they found themselves face to face with the Huntley and Palmer
biscuit tin which was the home of the Perez family. Here they lived as
happily as the rat of fable did in the Dutch cheese. Perez the Mouse
introduced the King as a foreign tourist who was
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<!-- png 42-->
on a visit to the capital, and the family welcomed him very cordially.
The two Miss Mouses were at work with their Governess, Miss Stilton, who
was a very learned English mouse,
<span class = "figleft">
<img src = "images/silh_22.png" width = "106" height = "118"
alt = "silhouette"></span>
and Mrs. Mouse was embroidering a beautiful smoking cap for her husband,
sitting by a bright fire made of raisin stalks.</p>

<p>This happy family party delighted King Bubi.<span class =
"para">&nbsp;*</span>Adelaide and Elvira made tea and poured out some
into lovely wee cups made out of the skins of white beans.<span class =
"para">&nbsp;*</span>Then they had a little music. Adelaide sang
Desdemona&rsquo;s song, &lsquo;O&nbsp;Willow Willow,&rsquo; in a way
which much
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<!-- png 45-->
pleased the King, and Elvira recited about a little mouse who was ill of
fever, and a naughty kitten who wanted to pounce on it. After this
Adolphus came in from the Jockey Club where, to the sorrow of his father
and mother, he wasted all his time playing cards with the mice from the
foreign embassies.</p>

Perez the Mouse stopped at some crossway</p>

<p>King Bubi would willingly have stayed longer, but Perez, who had
slipped away, came back with his satchel on his back and said it was
time to start.<span class = "para">&nbsp;*</span>So the King said
goodbye very politely, and Mrs. Mouse gave him a kiss on each cheek in

Adelaide put out a paw in a lackadaisical

made him a beautiful cheese of a curtsey, and then stared at him through
her eyeglass until he was out of sight.<span class =

as far as the lid of the tin, and offered to introduce him at the Polo
Club, for which the King thanked him very much, thinking all the time
that, though he might be a very smart young mouse, he was rather a bore.
<span class = "figleft">

Then Bubi and Perez the Mouse again began their scamper with such a

<p><span class = "figright">
<img src = "images/silh_25.png" width = "125" height = "92"

Perez the Mouse then confessed that he would not have undertaken this

<p>All of a sudden King Bubi saw the guard in front had disappeared down
a little hole, through which came a faint light.</p>

<p>This was the moment of danger. Perez the Mouse, slowly waggling his
tail from side to side, put his

head very cautiously through the hole and looked around; he then went
back two steps, and finally, suddenly seizing the King&rsquo;s paw,
dashed through the hole like an arrow, crossed a big kitchen, and
disappeared through another hole on the opposite side near the range. As
one sees telegraph posts out of the train so Bubi saw that kitchen. By
the hearth, in the glow of the fire, lay an enormous cat, the dreadful
Don Pedro, its great whiskers heaving up and down as it breathed.</p>

<p><span class = "figleft">
<img src = "images/silh_8.png" width = "60" height = "92"

The guards silently formed up, from hole to hole, ready to fire, to
protect the King&rsquo;s route from the
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>

sleeping cat. It was all very grand and imposing. An ugly old woman sat
in a chair, also asleep, with her knitting on her knee.</p>

<p><span class = "figright">
<img src = "images/silh_33.png" width = "62" height = "63"

Once through the hole the danger was over, and they had only to get
upstairs, as this was where little Giles lived. Everything was open in
his poor room, which was all cracks and draughts.</p>

<p>King Bubi scrambled on to the arm of a seatless chair, the only one
in the room, and from there could see a picture of poverty such as he
had never dreamt&nbsp;of.</p>

the holes the cold air of dawn was coming, while icicles hung from the
roof. The only furniture besides the chair was an empty bread basket
hanging up, and in a corner a bed of straw and rags, on which little
Giles and his mother were lying fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class = "figright">
<img src = "images/silh_25.png" width = "125" height = "92"
alt = "silhouette"></span>
Perez the Mouse drew nearer, taking the King by the paw, and they could
see how little Giles was huddled up in the rags, and how he was cuddled
up against his mother for warmth, and it made the King so unhappy that
he began to cry.</p>

darling? God has given you everything in order that your younger
brothers should want for nothing.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&nbsp;never knew this
before,&rsquo; said Bubi, shaking his head, and, without thinking any
more about his present, he began to say his prayers, as he did every
morning; and, as he prayed, it seemed to him that all the poor little
boys in the kingdom came round him with their hands clasped, and that
he, the eldest brother, spoke for them all when he prayed &lsquo;Our
Father which art in Heaven.&rsquo;</p>

poor and rich, good and bad, &lsquo;Our Father which art in

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
